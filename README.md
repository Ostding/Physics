# Physics
Fixed float based physics

# Done:
.Build a fixed float library  
.Build an application to exam the fixed float library's precision and synchornization between android and osx  
devices [to check the result, plz move to benchmark.txt]  
.Basic types build from fixed float, such as vector3 quaternion matrix3x3 matrix4x4 has already been added  
.An application of physic world framework testing  
![image](https://github.com/Ostding/Physics/blob/master/images/demo.png)  
.Basic primitives supported, such as sphere cube convex polyhedron capsule  
.Add octree for optimize  

# Todo:
.Add various kinds of force, such as move force, spring force etc  
.Add BVHTree support  
.Add joint support  
.Exam the physic library's precision and synchornization between android and osx devices
