# Physics
Fixed float based physics

# Done:
.build a fixed float library  
.exam the fixed float library's precision and synchornization between android and osx  
devices [to check the result, plz move to benchmark.txt]  

# Todo:
.add basic types, such as vector3 quaternion matrix3x3 matrix4x4  
.add physic world framework  
.add collision process pipline  
.add basic primitives, such as sphere cube cylinder capsule convex polyhedron  
.exam the physic library's precision and synchornization between android and osx devices
